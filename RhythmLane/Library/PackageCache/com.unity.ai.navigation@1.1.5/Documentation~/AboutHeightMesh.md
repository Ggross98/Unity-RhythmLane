# HeightMesh
The HeightMesh allows for the character to be placed more accurately on the ground. While navigating, the NavMesh Agent is constrained on the surface of the NavMesh. Since the NavMesh is an approximation of the walkable space, some features are evened out when the NavMesh is being built. For example, stairs may appear as a slope in the NavMesh. Without the HeightMesh the characters are moved along the approximate NavMesh surface. If your game requires accurate placement of the agent, you should enable the HeightMesh option when you build the NavMesh. Note that building the HeightMesh will take up memory and processing at runtime, and it will lengthen the total time of baking the NavMesh.
